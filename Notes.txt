   b) Binding Event Handlers
   c) Directly overwrite this.state other places this.setState
 2) static getDerivedStateFromProps(props,state) => return object representing new state
 3) render()
 4) componentdidMount() => only once in lifecycle of a given component
 will be called once the component and all its children renders to the DOM
